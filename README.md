# Credit_Score_Prediction

### Project Overview
Credit scoring is an essential process used by lenders to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses. This assessment aids in deciding whether to approve a loan application and determining the appropriate interest rate to charge. Creditworthiness is typically based on several factors, including the applicant's credit history, income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio.

### Objective
The objective of a credit score prediction project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict credit scores. This model can then be used by lenders to make more informed decisions about loan applications.
